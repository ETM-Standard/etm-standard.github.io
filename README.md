# Extensible Token Metadata (ETM) Standard

This repository tracks ongoing improvements to the ETM standard. In the current building phase, it is maintained by the creators of the repository, but the future goal is to have this process maintained by the community.

For an introduction to the ETM standard, start [here](https://standards.niftyisland.com/).

If you would like to become an ETM collaborator, please email zunk@niftyisland.io.

## Mission

The ETM standard is a forward-looking standard which seeks to future-proof usability of NFT metadata. This is achieved by providing a few clear and well-defined guidelines which allow the metadata to be extended in an unambiguous way.

## Discussion

For now, discussions should take place in the [GitHub Discussions board for this repo](https://github.com/Nifty-Island/etm-standard/discussions).
